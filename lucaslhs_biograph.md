- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucaslhs
  
- 👀 I’m interested in post on the website my projects developed since the beginning of 2023, ranging from the simplest projects to some slightly more complex ones.
  
- 🌱 I am currently learning about different programming languages ​​at a technical school.
  
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in the future in the IT area, with the aim of migrating to the area that really interests me, criminal law.
